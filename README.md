# Google Calendar Aggregator

This application aggregates multiple Google Calendars into a single "Consolidated View" calendar. It creates a master calendar and populates it with "Busy" events from your source calendars, with customizable colors and comprehensive sync capabilities.

## Features

- **Multi-Calendar Sync**: Aggregate events from multiple Google Calendars
- **Color-Coded Events**: Assign different colors to distinguish between source calendars  
- **Smart Date Range**: Syncs events from 30 days back to 365 days forward (395 days total)
- **Automatic Calendar Discovery**: Lists all accessible calendars to help with configuration
- **Flexible Event Handling**: Supports both timed events and all-day events
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time sync progress with detailed logging
- **Cloud Deployment Ready**: Includes Google Cloud deployment scripts

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Google account with calendar access
- Google Cloud Project (for API access)

### Installation

1. **Enable the Google Calendar API:**
   - Follow the [Google Calendar API Python Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python)
   - Enable the Calendar API in your Google Cloud Console
   - Download your `credentials.json` file to the project root

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure calendars:**
   Edit `calendars.json` to specify your source calendars:
   ```json
   {
     "source_calendars": [
       {
         "calendar_id": "your.email@gmail.com",
         "display_name": "Personal",
         "color": "eucalyptus"
       },
       {
         "calendar_id": "work.email@company.com", 
         "display_name": "Work",
         "color": "cobalt"
       }
     ],
     "target_calendar_name": "Consolidated View"
   }
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Configuration

### Calendar Colors
Available colors for visual distinction:
- `eucalyptus` (green)
- `cobalt` (blue) 
- `grape` (purple)
- `tomato` (red)
- `tangerine` (orange)
- `banana` (yellow)
- `peacock` (turquoise)
- `lavender` (light purple)

### First Run
On first execution, the script will:
1. Display all your accessible calendars with their IDs
2. Prompt for Google account authorization
3. Create the target "Consolidated View" calendar if it doesn't exist
4. Sync all events from configured source calendars

## Cloud Deployment

For automated scheduling, use the included Google Cloud deployment script:

```bash
chmod +x gcloud_startup.sh
./gcloud_startup.sh
```

This sets up the necessary cloud infrastructure for periodic synchronization.
